The original bug mis-assign the _EXPERT_MODEL_PARALLEL_GROUP. This group is used in _gather_along_first_dim_expert_parallel (an all-gather nccl) during distributed training.

As injection, we directly inject at AllGatherSplitPrim to have an expanded group ranks, which simulate the same effect as the original bug.
